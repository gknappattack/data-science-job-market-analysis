Subject: Join the Data‑Science Job Market Analysis Project – Sign Up Now!

Dear Students,

Thank you to everyone who volunteered to contribute to our Data‑Science Job Market Analysis project! This is an exciting opportunity to conduct a real‑world analysis of data‑science employment trends and build a valuable resource for current and future cohorts. Here’s how to get started.

### Overview of the Project
We will collect publicly available job‑posting data, categorize roles (e.g., data analyst, data engineer, machine learning engineer), and identify the skills employers are requesting. The project is collaborative and fully open source, so you’ll work in small teams and contribute via GitHub.

### How to Sign Up for a Team
1. **Complete the volunteer form** – Please fill out this short form by [insert deadline]. The form asks for your preferred team (Data Collection, Role Taxonomy, Skills Analysis, Visualization/Reporting) and a brief note on your experience or interests.
2. **Join our GitHub repo** – If you don’t already have one, create a free GitHub account. Navigate to our repository: `https://github.com/trgardos/data-science-job-market-analysis`.
3. **Choose a task** – Once teams are formed, we will create GitHub issues describing specific tasks. Each team member can select an issue to work on by commenting on it. We’ll use issue templates to ensure clarity and consistency in how tasks are described.

### Next Steps After Signing Up
- **Kickoff Meeting** – We will schedule a virtual orientation in the first week after sign‑ups close. At this meeting we’ll go over the project scope, timeline, and how to use GitHub (issues, pull requests, documentation).
- **Communication Channels** – We will set up a shared Slack or MS Teams channel for questions and quick updates. Team leads will organize regular check‑ins to monitor progress.
- **Getting Started Guide** – Once you’ve been assigned to a team, please read the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in the repository. These files outline the project goals, repository structure, and guidelines for contributing.

We’re excited to see what insights you uncover as we analyze the data‑science job market together. If you have any questions before the kickoff, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to working with you all!

Best regards,
